# Version History
## 0.1.0 - 2/26/2018
Started using the graph feature on Google Flights to glean the data. Speeds things up by about 30x-50x compared to Version 0.0.0. Since things are so much quicker, we are able to efficiently check the prices of about 20 destinations. The search window can also be dramatically increased.
## 0.0.0 - 2/23/2018
Just getting things off the ground. Very unpolished.
