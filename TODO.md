## To Do
| Task |
|:----:|
|Actually automate the thing so that it doesn't need to be called from the command line. Will need to see if we can get Selenium running on an AWS EC2 Linux instance |
|Create a way to easily track past submissions. We don't want the same deals being posted everyday just because one destination fluctuates price a lot.|
|Add support for pictures|
